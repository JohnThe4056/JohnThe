            <h1>Description</h1>
            <p>
            The game, Gobo Killer, embodies the ideas of World War 1 and 2. 
            Essentially, Gobos invade your home planet, and the player is forced 
            to protect the people of your home planet. The player is forced
            into a fight or die, which is a reference to Benjaminn Franklin's 
            "Join or Die" slogan for the war of independence. For each Gobo the 
            player kills, points are rewarded to the player on the basis of a 
            time multipler. For the randomness, Gobos spawn at random places
            across to add an aiming aspect to the game. The game also gets 
            unnecessarily impossible as time progress, however, an upgrade 
            system is implemented to postpone the inevitable defeat. Gobo Killer
            is a survival game in which the player have 3 lives, that will
            postpone the inevitable destruction the planet will face.

            <h1>Reflection</h1>
            <p>
            My friend Kent and I created this game because as children, we 
            played many survival flash games that involved "protecting the 
            planet" and being heros.Because of this, we followed our inspiration 
            and sought to recreate essentially our childhoods. In the development
            of Gobo Killer, we were able to successfully implement upgrade
            difficulty scaling systems, those that used variables. However, 
            there were many bumpy roads
            </p>
            <h2>Algorithm Example</h2>
            <img src= "Capture.PNG" border="3" height="400" width="400">
            <p>This is an algorithm because it automates the spawn timers and
            positions of the Gbos while in game. It works by taking account the
            variables of "Time" and "GameOn?" to determine whether the game is 
            live, and it uses spawn timer variable "GoboSpawn" to scale 
            the spawns as the timer progress. There is also randomness
            when the algorithm specifies where the Gobo can spawn.
            </p>

            <p>In this story, it is about a boy named Billy Bong who is faced with a hardship and has to make decisions that could lead to his survival or death.</p>

            <p>The incremental and iterative process of the story started with the idea of making the story with a hint of humor and a base <br>
            where we could make it more in-depth later in the process. There many possible endings that could have made, but we chose to make <br>
            most of our endings dark with only one happy ending if the people interacting with the story could reach that ending. In order for us <br>
            to make sure each storyline was going to work, Kent and I went through each route and made sure that the story kept continuing no matter <br>
            what chose the individual interacting with the story chose. There problems that were encountered such as the inability for the program to <br>
            show the rest of the story becasue the story was too long. We checked if each path worked and made sure that each one would end up at <br>
            the next event that we expected it to. We started with defining the function, then givng the function a name, and then having the function <br>
            a role in what it should do once the program is ran.</p>
